I am a Professor and Chair of the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. In addition, I am a Research Fellow in the Center for International Development and Conflict Managment.

My research is on international politics, civil war, and foreign policy decision-making. I teach courses on international relations, foreign policy, the United Nations, applied game theory, applied regression analysis, and applied maximum likelihood estimation.
